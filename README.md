# Introduction and Timeline

## Overview

This repository introduces the patient’s case and provides a verified chronological timeline of auditory, neurological, and functional events. It is designed to give clinicians rapid situational awareness and establish the context needed to interpret the detailed evidence contained in the remaining repositories.

The goal is clarity:  
What happened, when it happened, and how the functional picture evolved.

## Purpose of This Module

This module serves as the structural entry point to the medical documentation suite. It provides:

- A concise, professional introduction to the patient  
- A high‑level summary of the case  
- A date‑anchored timeline of symptoms, evaluations, and functional changes  
- Orientation for how the remaining repositories fit together  

Clinicians should be able to read this module first and immediately understand the logic and sequence of the case.

## Patient Introduction (Concise, Professional)

The patient is an adult with long‑standing auditory processing challenges, progressive decline in speech comprehension, and a history of misinterpretation and under-recognition of symptoms. Despite normal peripheral hearing thresholds, the patient has experienced persistent difficulty parsing speech, especially in complex or noisy environments.

Over time, these challenges have intensified, resulting in significant functional impact across communication, work, and daily life. The subsequent repositories document this progression with precision and evidence-based clarity.

## High-Level Summary of the Case

- Early signs of atypical auditory processing emerged in childhood.  
- Speech clarity issues persisted through adolescence and adulthood despite normal audiograms.  
- Functional communication breakdowns increased over time, particularly in multi-speaker or noisy environments.  
- Multiple evaluations produced inconsistent or incomplete interpretations.  
- The clinical picture increasingly pointed toward central auditory involvement.  
- Further neurological evaluation, including imaging, became necessary to clarify the underlying mechanism.  
- This suite reconstructs the case in a modular, clinician‑oriented format.

## Chronological Timeline

(This section will be updated as the detailed timeline is finalized.)

| **Date / Period** | **Event** | **Functional Impact** | **Linked Module** |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Early childhood | First signs of atypical auditory processing | Difficulty parsing speech in noise; early compensatory strategies | gr_02_auditory_baseline |
| Adolescence | Increasing difficulty with speech clarity | Reliance on visual cues; fatigue; misinterpretations | gr_03_functional_impact |
| 20s | Initial formal hearing evaluations | Normal thresholds; no explanation for clarity issues | gr_04_audiology_mismatch |
| 30s | Progressive decline in speech comprehension | Escalating communication failures; occupational and social strain | gr_05_breakdowns |
| 2020–2023 | Multiple evaluations with inconsistent interpretations | Continued mismatch between lived function and test results | gr_06_provider_interactions |
| 2024 | Recognition of central auditory involvement | Shift toward neurological framing | gr_07_neuro_overview |
| 2025 | Request for fMRI to evaluate auditory cortex | Need for structural/functional imaging | gr_08_neuro_imaging |
| 2025–2026 | Development of comprehensive documentation suite | Modular evidence-based reconstruction | All modules |

## How This Module Connects to the Suite

This repository functions as the map key for the entire system. Each major event in the timeline corresponds to a dedicated module:

- Auditory baseline and clarity issues → gr_02, gr_03  
- Audiology mismatch → gr_04  
- Functional communication breakdowns → gr_05  
- Provider interactions and interpretations → gr_06  
- Neurological framing and imaging → gr_07, gr_08  
- Advocacy, reconstruction, and supporting evidence → gr_09–gr_18  

Clinicians can navigate the suite linearly or jump directly to the module most relevant to their specialty.
